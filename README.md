# RSProto
RSProto is a framework that designed to provide ability to expose your API as RPC Services. It facilitates the creation of gRPC-like services from .proto files through code generation. The framework also provides essential core components for both server and client.

> **Warning** <br>
> This project is still under development and it's not production-ready.

## Features
- **Gradle Plugin**: `.proto` to RSocket code generator (both client and server).
- **Server Core** (JVM only): Interceptors, Instances API and bridge between Ktor and library.
- **Client Core** (JVM, Web, iOS): Metadata and basic interface-markers.

## Getting Started
First of all, you should have the following repository:
```kotlin
repositories {
    maven("https://maven.timemates.io")
}
```

### Core components
Before using builtin generation from `.proto` to RSocket services, you should add the following dependencies:
```kotlin
dependencies {
    // for server
    implementation("io.timemates.rsproto:server-core:$version")
    // for client
    implementation("io.timemates.rsproto:client-core:$version")
}
```
#### Server initialization
To configure your server, you can use ready-to-use build-bridges between Ktor and RSProto:
```kotlin
fun Application.configureServer() {
    routing {
        rSocketServer("/rsocket") {
            interceptor(MyInterceptor())
            service(MyService())

            instances {
                protobuf { 
                    encodeDefaults = true
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```
#### Client initialization
Clients are generated by the code-generation Gradle plugin. To use them you need instance of `rsocket` and `protobuf`:
```kotlin
val apiService = TestServiceApi(rsocket, protobuf)
apiService.sayHello()
```

### Code-generation plugin
To implement code-generation plugin in your buildscript, add the following:
```kotlin
plugins {
    id("io.timemates.rsproto.plugin") version "$version"
}
```
And use it inside your buildscript:
```kotlin
generateProto {
    protoSourcePath = "src/main/proto"
    generationOutputPath = "generated/proto-generator/src/commonMain"
    clientGeneration = true
    serverGeneration = true
}
```
